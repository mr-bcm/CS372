A Taste of Thai|419 W Hastings Rd|While a few friends prefer Pad Thai at other restaraunts, everyone agrees that the curry is amazing. I personally have liked everything that I have tried here.|4
Panda Express|9522 N Newport Hwy|Great for quick and tasty chinese food. This may not be the most authentic, but it is very enjoyable|4
Jack in the Box|5 W Hawthorne Rd Spokane, WA 99218|It's fast food, and nothing special even for that. Nothing notably bad or good. Took a while to get my food one time and they gave me a free small frys, so that was cool.|3

McDondald's|9305 N Newport Hwy Spokane, WA 99218|This location is convenient due to being 24-hours, serving breakfast starting at midnight, and having pretty quick service. That being said, if you visit the restaurant late at night (anytime between 11pm and 3am, give or take) don't expect much from the quality of food. You'd think the quality would be better and fresher at night, but it isn't. Fries are hard and cold. The cheeseburger I got recently tasted different, so I opened it up to find 1 small pickle, no onion,  5 tiny splatters of mustard and 5 tiny dots of ketchup, that looked more like polka dots on the bun than condiments. It was as if the ketchup and mustard containers were getting empty and a tiny bit just splattered the bun, which was dry. Words don't do it justice, so I'll attach a photo (see under restaurant photos). This isn't expensive or high quality food - but a little consistency would be nice.|2
